## DESCRIPTION ##

* Modified plugin.xml to be cordova plugman compatible

* This plugin provides a simple way to use the `UIActionSheet` native component from iOS.

* This plugin is built for Cordova >= v2.1.0 with ARC.

* There is a `Sencha Touch 2.0` plugin to easily leverage this plugin [here](https://github.com/mgcrea/sencha-touch-plugins/blob/master/CordovaActionSheet.js)

## SAMPLE PROJECT GENERATION ##

You can generate a sample XCode project by running `samples/ios/create.sh` from the root of the repository. You will have to manually add the `ActionSheet` folder to Xcode (see step 2).

## PLUGIN SETUP FOR IOS ##

Using this plugin requires [Cordova iOS](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-ios).

1. Make sure your Xcode project has been [updated for Cordova](https://github.com/apache/incubator-cordova-ios/blob/master/guides/Cordova%20Upgrade%20Guide.md)
2. Drag and drop the `src/ios` folder from the Finder to your `Plugins` folder in XCode, using "Create groups for any added folders", rename the folder to `ActionSheet`.
3. Add the .js files to your `www` folder on disk, and add reference(s) to the .js files using `<script>` tags in your html file(s)


    `<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/plugins/ActionSheet.js"></script>`


4. Add new entry with key `ActionSheet` and value `ActionSheet` to `Plugins` in `Cordova.plist/Cordova.plist`

## JAVASCRIPT INTERFACE (IOS/ANDROID) ##

    // After device ready, create a local alias
    var actionSheet = window.plugins.actionSheet;

    // Basic with title
    actionSheet.create({title: 'Title', items: ['Foo', 'Bar']}, function(buttonValue, buttonIndex) {
        console.warn('create(), arguments=' + Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).join(', '));
    });

    // Complex
    actionSheet.create({items: ['Add', 'Delete', 'Cancel'], destructiveButtonIndex: 1, cancelButtonIndex: 2}, function(buttonValue, buttonIndex) {
        console.warn('create(), arguments=' + Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments).join(', '));
    });

* Check [source](https://github.com/mgcrea/cordova-actionsheet/tree/master/www/ActionSheet.js) for additional configuration.

## BUGS AND CONTRIBUTIONS ##

Patches welcome! Send a pull request. Since this is not a part of Cordova Core (which requires a CLA), this should be easier.
